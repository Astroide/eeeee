This might be happening because block comments in Escurieux nest, so /* /* */ (which would be valid in many programming languages) is not valid in Escurieux.',
    E00002: 'Hexadecimal numbers must contain at least one digit: This error happens because there is a hexadecimal number start \'0x\' that is not followed by a dot or at least one hexadecimal digit.',

This is usually caused when a backslash is the last character of a string that is not terminated or when an hexadecimal (0x) or octal (0o) number start is at the end of the file, followed by no digits.',
