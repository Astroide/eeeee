<h2>Introduction</h2>
In Escurieux, everything (except imports and macros, because these are compile-time things) is an expression. Classes are expressions. Functions are expressions. Variable declarations are expressions.

<h3>Data types</h3>
These are the fundamental data types of Escurieux:
* `string`
* `int` (64 bits integer)
* `int32` (32 bits integer)
* `iint` (infinite-size integer)
* `float` (64 bits floating-point)
* `float32` (32 bits floating-point)
* `ifloat` (infinite-size and infinite-precision floating-point)
* `char` (character)
* `boolean` (boolean)

Note that numeric types are by default 64 bits.

All these types are classes, which means that instance of these types have methods and fields, just like any other object.

<h3>Basic Operators</h3>
The number types support these operators : `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`
