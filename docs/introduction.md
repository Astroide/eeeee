## Introduction
In Escurieux, everything (except imports and macros, because these are compile-time things) is an expression. Classes are expressions. Functions are expressions. Variable declarations are expressions.

### Data types
These are the fundamental data types of Escurieux:
* `string`
* `int` (64 bits integer)
* `int32` (32 bits integer)
* `iint` (infinite-size integer)
* `float` (64 bits floating-point)
* `float32` (32 bits floating-point)
* `ifloat` (infinite-size and infinite-precision floating-point)
* `char`
* `boolean`

Note that numeric types are by default 64 bits.
