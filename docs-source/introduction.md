# 1 - Introduction
$E is a language made of expressions. Every $E program is an expression.
There are different types of expressions:
* Literals : these are just a piece of data. Literals aren't composed of other expressions. There are number literals (decimal: §0.234§, §3244.3§, §42§, hexadecimal: §0xFF§, §0xabcde§, §0x0.FE4§, octal: §0o755§, §0o100.23§, binary: §0b1010001011§, §0b0.001§), string literals (§"some text here"§) which can contain newlines, character literals, which are only one character long (§'t§, §'"§) and boolean literals (§true§ or §false§).
